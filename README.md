# Autonomous-Drone-Project
Develop a control algorithm for a drone to naviagte in an unknown environment and reach the destination in the shortest time with minimal deviation from environment boundary. Control is tested in the Linux environment using rospy and Gazebo and the performance is assessed in a real obstacle course.
